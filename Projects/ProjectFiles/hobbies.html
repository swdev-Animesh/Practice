    <p>
      I am a very curious person who always have a little too much for myselt to
      take. I have quiet an experience in vast number of things including sales
      , customer support , marketing , development and whAT NOT .I have had also
      made a startup (which is closed now).....<br />
      I would have to take some time to write this down , lots of things can be
      said here but making the most out of simple words and keeping it short and
      simple is what is needed here . Will update this soon or in final
      revision.
