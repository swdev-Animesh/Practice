        <p>
          Almost a decade ago I was busy teaching math to teenagers at three
          schools in London and Cambridge. Since I’m a bit of a coding geek, I
          also built websites on the side for friends and family. I soon learned
          that web development was a very lucrative career choice, so I gave up
          my successful (and sometimes stressful) job as a teacher to build
          websites. Today, I couldn’t be happier with that decision. After
          building websites for about seven years, I noticed a lot of people
          struggling to learn how to code. I wanted others to have the same
          freedoms that I enjoyed, so I started teaching web development I'm
          familiar with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React js, Nodejs ,Expressjs ,
          nextjs, mondoDB,AWS Illustrator ,bootstrap5,Sass, and MySQL. Checkout
          some of the projects I've done below.
